# pebble-notifier

**This is not working yet, come back later.**

Send OS X 10.8 Notification Center messages to your [Pebble][1]. 

Keep in mind that you can only pair one device at a time, so when paired
to your Mac, you won't get notifications from your phone.

### Requirements

- patience, as this is quite a hack at the moment
- ```$ sudo gem install terminal-notifier``
- [libpebble][2]
- Xcode and shit, of course.

### Usage

```$ xcodebuild```

``$ build/pebble-notifier```

**Enjoy being spammed on your watch!**
